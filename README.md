# PediAssist - AI-Powered Pediatric Subspecialty Treatment Assistant

**Empowering general pediatricians with instant access to subspecialty-level treatment planning.**

## üéØ Vision

"Every pediatrician deserves a team of subspecialist consultants in their pocket"

PediAssist eliminates fragmented care and enables comprehensive pediatric healthcare delivery without unnecessary referrals.

## üè• Problem Solved

- General pediatricians lack immediate subspecialty guidance for complex conditions
- Patient experience becomes fragmented with multiple referrals  
- Delays in treatment initiation due to referral wait times
- Knowledge gaps in managing conditions outside core pediatric training
- Limited access to subspecialists in underserved areas
